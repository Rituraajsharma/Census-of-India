# Census-of-India

# 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Census of India dataset. 
The aim is to extract meaningful insights, visualize demographic trends, and understand the distribution of various socio-economic indicators.

# 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the official Census of India website. 
It includes demographic features such as population, literacy rate, gender ratio, age distribution, employment status, and more.
